service-->

k expose deploy day-6 --type=LoadBalancer --port=8080

types of services in k8s-->

cluster IP--when we want keep app/db as internal service

NodePOrt-- app access is on port, very dangerous for attack,multiple pod need to open as port get assigned to app

LoadBalancer-- 

headLess-- no external or internal ip assigned/ mostly used for DB's
when you want take control and decide, where you want to route the traffic at particular pod


endpoints vs slices

 endpoint slice is an abstraction

endpoint slices run ender the services

pods are ephemeral in nature--ip is not fixed for pod, for dies, pod re-create, everytime k8s assigns new ip to it

purpose of endpoint slice is to group the pods

by default 100 n/w endpoint/pods can into endpoint slice, but configured upto 1000 slices

EndpointSlice

When we create a service, by default endpoint slice get created.



K expose deploy day-6 --port 8080

K get endpointslices (under endpoints you will see ip address of pods)



K get pods -o wide



You have created new pod after EndpointSlice deployment and want to edit that



K edit endpointslice EndpointSlice_name



endpoints:

  addresses:

      -10.2.3.4

  addresses:

       -10.3.4.5

  



Noport- node ka port



Target port- traffic kha bhejna hai

In docker file we expose port, that port is same as target port



Port- service ka port



By default port is target port.

And protocol is TCP

Can you have service without selector? Yes

For that you need to make one endpointslice and add



Ip's of node doesn't have any relation with ip's of svc





K expose deploy day-6 --type LoadBalancer --port=8080 -> this will automatically create a load balancer in your corresponding cloud provider



--- the dashes, in one single file we can write multiple yaml files



K logs -n ingress-nginx -l app.kubernetes.io/name=ingress-nginx



Error-404 page not found

How to solve

Go to ingress yml file

In spec add.

spec: 

    ingressClassName:nginx

         



Cloud load balancer and kubernets load balancer service is same
